# Create Eleact App ![GitHub package.json version](https://img.shields.io/github/package-json/v/sellectuwa/create-eleact-app)
Create cross-platform desktop apps with no configuration. 

When creating the project, I was inspired by:
* [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) by Facebook
* [electron-typescript-react](https://github.com/diego3g/electron-typescript-react) by Diego Fernandes

## Usage

```sh
npm install -g create-eleact-app
create-eleact-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start
```

## Plans for future
* TypeScript support
* Simplify the configuration by creating a separate library that will handle scripts (similar to react-scripts)
* Documentation
* More frameworks support (Vue, Angular, etc.)
